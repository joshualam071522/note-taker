## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an app where one person could take notes and have the ability to save, view, and delete those notes on a live server. This app showcases the basics of a full-stack application, having both client and server properties. The main technologies used to deploy this app incldue express, helpers such as fsUtils and uuid, and bootstrap. This project helped me apply the basics of the use of express.js and helping me simulate a full-stack application!

## Installation

In order to install this application, the user would have to clone the repository. From there, they would use the command "npm install" to install all the relevant packages.

## Usage

To use the application from Heroku, Simply visit the link! However, the server might not be up, but you can still use the application using github!

To use the application from github, one must simply start the server by typing in the command terminal "npm start". From there, they will can reach the base website by address: localhost:3001. From there, they will see the landing page with a blue button that "says get started". The blue button will take you to the note page of the application where the user can start creating, viewing, and deleting notes. On the left hand side, you will see that it says "No saved Notes". You will also notice on the right side the words "Note Title" and "Note Text" right under it. There, you will be able to create your new note! Simply click on where it says "Note Title" and you can create your first note title. After you are done with that, you can click on "Note Text" to create the specifics of your note". Once both fields are filled out, you will notice that a save button icon has appeared above! Clicking on the save button will save your note to the database and you will see the newly create note title on the left hand side. If you want to view that note again, just click on the note title. From there, you can click on another note title on the left hand list to view another note, or you can press the + button above the right hand side to start a new note. You will also notice that each note title on the left hand side has a delete button. Pressing that delete button will automatically delete that note from the database!
